## Directions

Before making any edits to this file, please rename it such that it includes your first and last name (e.g., "LuanaLima_TSA_A01_Sp25.Rmd")

Once you have this renamed file open in RStudio, the first thing you will do is replace "author:" on line 3 with your name. 
Then you will start working through the assignment by  **creating code and output** that answer each question. Be sure to use this assignment document. Your report should contain the answer to each question and any plots/tables you obtained (when applicable).

When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.  Submit this pdf using Sakai. 

## Questions

Q1. What are your previous experiences with time series analysis, R, and Git? 

> Answer: One year ago, I completed ENV 872 (Environmental Data Exploration), where we got a very brief preview of time series analysis. My experience with R and Git started in ENV 872, and then I completed ENV 710 (Applied Stats) last semester, where we used R but not Git. 


Q2. (Only if you choose to use git) Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file as instructed on the recorded video "Getting started with Git and Github".

Q3. For this part we just want to see the path to your R project. No need to do anything. The output will be automatically generated once you knit you file. 

> Answer: This is my working directory:

```{r}
getwd()
```

Q4. Copy and paste the link to your forked repository on Github. It should looks like this: "https://github.com/lmmlima/TSA_Sp25"

> Answer: This is my forked repository: https://github.com/gaby-cz/TSA_Sp25_GC.git
